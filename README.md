# RockstarDrink Analytics

When you run the script, a welcome message will display, then you can click ok to continue to choose your sales data file 

The application will then analyze the data and display the sales trends and total cases sold for each drink in the form of line plots and bar plots. If store information is provided, the application will generate separate plots for each store.

The provided csv files can be saved into any location in your directory and you can modify the data as needed. But keep in mind this application is designed to be used with the provided dataset format.
